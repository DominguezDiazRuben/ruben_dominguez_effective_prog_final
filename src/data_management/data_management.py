"""
This module called *data_management* prepares the inputs for the 
*analysis step*.  

First, it loads the raw data from the
folder *original_data*. 

Second, since the original dataset it large, the 
goal is to keep the variables of interest so that we don't have
to carry out the whole analysis with a heavy dataframe.

Third, it renames the variables that we are going to use to 
more user-friendly names, such that we can access them more
easily without need to look for them in manual repeatedly.

Fourth, it generates some additional variables that are interesting
for the final results. These are:
   * income_total: a broader measure of total income.
   * income_capital: a measure of total capital income.
   * net_home_equity: total housing assets minus total secured debt.
   * debt_non_secured: total debt minus secured debt.

Finally it saves all these elements together into
a dataframe called *sfc_clean_pd* and saves it to the folder
*OUT_DATA*. This object will be the input for the analysis step.
